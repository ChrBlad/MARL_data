This repository contains the raw data used in "A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Price and Comfort Optimization in HVAC-Systems" and the control code for article "Data-Driven Offline Reinforcement Learning for HVAC-Systems"


A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach to Price and Comfort Optimization in HVAC-Systems:
Each folder represents the data gathered from one zoned UFH system and a four zoned UFH system. Each folder contains multiple CSV files, and a plotting file - dependencies are
Matplotlib and Pandas. Be aware when plotting different variables, this is not the most user-friendly script â€“ quite a lot of spaghetti code. We apologies in advance 

Data-Driven Offline Reinforcement Learning for HVAC-Systems:
control code used for this paper is located in "Offline_RL".
